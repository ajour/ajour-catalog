The guides have been tested\non tens of millions of adventures, and are probably the most reliable\npredictors of mission outcomes. Nevertheless, bug-for-bug replication of the\nadventures combat logic is a bit difficult, and so the guides may be misleading\nin some very rare circumstances.","numberOfDownloads":12757,"categories":[],"gameVersions":[{"flavor":"retail","gameVersion":"90005"}],"source":"townlong-yak"},{"id":36,"websiteUrl":"https://www.townlong-yak.com/addons/war-plan","dateReleased":"2021-05-17T21:01:35.116Z","name":"War Plan","summary":"Interface replacement for War Campaign missions.","numberOfDownloads":102,"categories":[],"gameVersions":[{"flavor":"retail","gameVersion":"90005"}],"source":"townlong-yak"},{"id":37,"websiteUrl":"https://www.townlong-yak.com/addons/master-plan","dateReleased":"2021-03-24T23:08:04.760Z","name":"Master Plan","summary":"Augments the Garrison and Naval Missions UI.","numberOfDownloads":139,"categories":[],"gameVersions":[{"flavor":"retail","gameVersion":"90005"}],"source":"townlong-yak"},{"id":38,"websiteUrl":"https://www.townlong-yak.com/addons/opie","dateReleased":"2021-03-23T22:08:08.237Z","name":"OPie","summary":"A pop-up radial menu.","numberOfDownloads":230,"categories":[],"gameVersions":[{"flavor":"classic","gameVersion":"11306"},{"flavor":"retail","gameVersion":"90005"}],"source":"townlong-yak"},{"id":39,"websiteUrl":"https://www.townlong-yak.com/addons/m6","dateReleased":"2021-05-26T21:43:02.790Z","name":"M6","summary":"150+ macro slots for every character specialization.","numberOfDownloads":36,"categories":[],"gameVersions":[{"flavor":"retail","gameVersion":"90005"}],"source":"townlong-yak"},{"id":40,"websiteUrl":"https://www.townlong-yak.com/addons/taintless","dateReleased":"2021-01-25T07:24:55.000Z","name":"TaintLess","summary":"Eliminates certain classes of taint errors.","numberOfDownloads":12,"categories":[],"gameVersions":[{"flavor":"retail","gameVersion":"90001"}],"source":"townlong-yak"},{"id":41,"websiteUrl":"https://www.townlong-yak.com/addons/spade","dateReleased":"2021-01-25T07:24:55.000Z","name":"Spade","summary":"Manage the Sunsong Ranch without opening your bags.","numberOfDownloads":7,"categories":[],"gameVersions":[{"flavor":"retail","gameVersion":"80300"}],"source":"townlong-yak"},{"id":42,"websiteUrl":"https://www.townlong-yak.com/addons/ogri-lazy","dateReleased":"2021-01-25T06:53:13.000Z","name":"Ogri'Lazy","summary":"Helps you play the Apexis note sequences in Ogri'la.","numberOfDownloads":10,"categories":[],"gameVersions":[{"flavor":"retail","gameVersion":"80300"}],"source":"townlong-yak"}]
